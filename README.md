# go-tds
An experimental pure-go TDS-driver.
With it you should be able to connect to Microsoft SQL Servers (2000, 2005, 2008, 2012 and up). When it's done, that is. Sybase will not be supported.

Needless to say, this is NOT ready for production. Most SELECT statements will fail at this time.

For now it's just a collection of random code that I use to get to know the TDS protocol.
